This project's intention is to revive the original Legacy Video Maker. 
This includes all the features of the 2018-2019 LVM, including file importing, an  account system, and much more!
It is not your typical LVM clone, this is meant to bring back all of the old features and is way diffferent from the LVM clones!

Please Note this project is still in beta so alot of things are broken.
